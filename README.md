# home-automation-hc-05-relay-basic
  Home automation consists of integrating technology in the construction of a home so that many of the systems (lights, heating, air conditioning, etc) are automated. In this Home automation project, we are going to control electrical appliances using an Android App and Arduino. We are going to use the HC-05 Bluetooth module for communication and a Relay Module to control AC appliances using DC voltages.
